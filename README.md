#HTML5 Character Sheet#

##What##
A homebrew character sheet for a custom roleplaying game designed by me. While built with HTML and styled with vanilla CSS, it's primarily meant for print.

##Why##
I needed to build a custom character sheet for a roleplaying game I've designed. Apart from tools like InDesign, Scribus or Excel, good ol' plain HTML and CSS felt the most natural. It's easy to customize, the history will be here in GitHub and developing it will be good review on CSS basics. Moreover, it'll be easier to make an interactive character sheet in the future.

As a developer I rarely get to do CSS that's actually put into physical form at some point. It'll be a nice venture on that front as well.

*The roleplaying game mentioned above is not public at the moment.*
